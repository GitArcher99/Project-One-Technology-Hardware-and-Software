Technology Needs Report
 Certified Public Accountant (CPA)
 The CPA needs a reliable and powerful computer setup to manage complicated and sensitive tax
 data for personal and business clients. A desktop computer with an Intel i7 processor, 16GB of
 RAM, and a 1TB SSD is ideal for speed and storage. Two monitors make it easier to work on
 multiple documents or programs at the same time. A printer/scanner combo is important for
 printing and securely saving client files. For software, the CPA should use Windows 11
 Professional for its extra security features, along with tax programs like QuickBooks or
 TurboTax. Microsoft 365 is great for creating and editing documents. Antivirus software like
 Norton 360 protects against viruses and malware. Security is very important because of the
 sensitive data handled. Using Multi-Factor Authentication will keep the system secure. A
 firewall adds another layer of protection from online threats. To make the setup comfortable and
 easy to use, two monitors reduce the need to switch between programs, and ergonomic
 keyboards and mice help avoid hand and wrist strain during long work hours. Human-computer
 interaction played a big role in choosing this setup. Dual monitors make work more efficient by
 reducing the need to constantly switch between windows. Clear displays improve readability,
 ensure comfort, which leads to better productivity over long periods.
 Tax Specialist
 The tax specialist needs a computer that’s easy to take on the go but still powerful enough for
 office work. A laptop with an Intel i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD works well.
 Adding a docking station lets the laptop connect to monitors and other accessories. A second
screen (external monitor) helps with reviewing data, and a headset with a microphone is handy
 for video calls with clients. The laptop should have Windows 11 Professional, tax software that
 works with the CPA’s tools, and CRM software like Zoho CRM to manage client information.
 Microsoft 365 is also needed for creating documents. For security, the tax specialist should use a
 VPN to safely access client information while working outside the office. Changing passwords
 regularly helps keep accounts safe. A laptop and docking station make it simple to move between
 client meetings and office work. The extra monitor makes it easier to work with multiple
 programs without constantly switching back and forth. The CRM system is easy to use and helps
 keep client information organized. These choices were made to keep things portable and simple.
 The laptop is easy to carry, and the docking station with the extra monitor makes it just as
 productive to work at a desk when needed. This setup works well both in and out of the office.
 Data-Entry Specialist
 The data-entry specialist works on entering tax information, so their setup doesn’t need to be as
 powerful. A desktop computer with an Intel i3 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD is
 enough. A single monitor is fine for this role, and a comfortable keyboard and mouse help with
 long typing sessions. The computer should run Windows 11 Home, and the specialist will need
 Microsoft Excel for organizing data. Tools like Alteryx can make entering and checking data
 faster and easier. To keep data safe, the system should have restricted access so the specialist can
 only see the information they need. Antivirus software protects the computer from online threats.
 The setup focuses on being simple and comfortable. Easy-to-use software prevents mistakes, and
 ergonomic equipment helps the specialist stay comfortable during long hours at work.
 Human-computer interaction shaped this setup by ensuring the system is simple and
straightforward. An easy-to-navigate setup reduces errors and makes training quicker, while
 ergonomic equipment keeps the specialist productive and comfortable.
 Network Setup
 For the office, a star network setup is the best option. This means all devices are connected to a
 central switch, which links to a secure router for the internet. If one device stops working, the
 rest of the network keeps running. Wireless access points let employees connect their phones or
 laptops wirelessly. The network will need a secure router, a switch to handle the wired
 connections, and Ethernet cables for fast, stable connections. Wireless access points will make it
 easier to work from anywhere in the office. This setup is simple, reliable, and easy to manage.
 It’s also ready for future expansion if the office grows. Human-computer interaction influenced
 this choice by focusing on ease of use and reliability. The star topology makes troubleshooting
 easier, while the wireless access points offer flexibility. Each role gets the tools and equipment
 they need to work efficiently and securely. Human-computer interaction guides these choices to
 ensure that the setups are easy to use, comfortable, and tailored to each user's specific needs,
 improving overall productivity and job satisfaction.
